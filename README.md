A fork of the minecraft wrapper in https://github.com/Edenhofer/abs.
The modifications are intended to work with Redhat Linux, specifically Amazon Linux 2.

All it includes is the minecraftd setup and script.  Minecraftd is a simple wrapper for the minecraft client written in bash.  In addition to being able to start/stop/backup your server, it includes options for shutting down your server when no one is connected.  Which is great because I'd trade an arm and a leg for more cpu credits on free micros.
